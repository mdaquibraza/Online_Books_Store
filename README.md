ðŸš€ **Successfully Completed My Data Analyst Project: Online Book Store Database ðŸ“š**

I'm excited to share a recent milestone in my learning journey â€” completing a full-fledged **SQL-based Data Analytics project** where I built and analyzed an **Online Book Store database**. This hands-on experience helped me apply core analytics and data management concepts to extract meaningful business insights.

---

ðŸ”§ **Project Overview**
I designed a relational database system for a fictional online bookstore that includes three main entities:
ðŸ“˜ `Books` â€“ book details, genre, stock, price
ðŸ‘¥ `Customers` â€“ personal & contact details
ðŸ›’ `Orders` â€“ order transactions, quantity, total amount


ðŸ“Š **Key Analytical Queries Performed:**
âœ… Retrieve all books in a specific genre (e.g., Fiction, Fantasy)
âœ… Identify books published after a given year
âœ… Segment customers by location (e.g., all customers from Canada)
âœ… Filter orders within a specific date range (e.g., November 2023)
âœ… Calculate total books sold and total revenue generated
âœ… Find the most expensive book and the lowest stock item
âœ… Identify customers who placed multiple orders
âœ… Analyze book sales by genre and top-selling items
âœ… List the top 3 most expensive books in a selected category

ðŸŽ¯ **Skills Demonstrated & Developed:**

* âœ… **SQL Query Writing** â€“ including `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`, subqueries
* âœ… **Database Design** â€“ creating and linking tables using `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY`
* âœ… **Problem Solving with Data** â€“ using SQL logic to answer business questions
* âœ… **Insight Generation** â€“ drawing conclusions from datasets
* âœ… **Reporting** â€“ organizing findings in a structured, readable format
